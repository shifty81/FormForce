# Multi-User Type Service Call Management System

## Overview

This update removes the external Servicecall.ai integration and implements a comprehensive in-house service call management system with three distinct user types: Client, Technician, and Admin.

## Architecture Changes

### Database Schema

#### New Tables

1. **users** (updated)
   - Added `user_type` field (client, technician, admin)

2. **service_calls**
   - Enhanced dispatch system with customer linking
   - Status tracking (pending, in-progress, completed, cancelled)
   - Priority management (low, normal, high, urgent)

3. **service_call_comments**
   - Real-time communication on service calls
   - User attribution and timestamps

4. **service_call_pictures**
   - Picture uploads with metadata
   - AI-powered serial number extraction
   - Technician comments per picture

5. **equipment**
   - Equipment tracking per service call and customer
   - Serial numbers, models, manufacturers
   - Location details

6. **qr_codes**
   - QR codes for customer locations
   - Active/inactive status management

7. **check_ins**
   - Technician check-in/check-out tracking
   - GPS coordinates support
